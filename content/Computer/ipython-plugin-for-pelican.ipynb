    "# [ipynb2pelican](https://github.com/peijunz/ipynb2pelican) Plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ipynb2pelican](https://github.com/peijunz/ipynb2pelican) plugin provides markup for Jupyter/IPython notebooks in pelican, so `.ipynb` files are recognized as a valid filetype for an article. \n",
    "\n",
    "## MetaCell\n",
    "The project is inspired by [pelican-ipynb](https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb), but do things the other way: MetaCell (i.e. Metadata Cell). \n",
    "With MetaCell, there is NO need to create another metadata file, or edit ipynb externally. Everything is inside Jupyter Notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact Idea of MetaCell is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **All and Only** Metadata should be stored at the first Cell of ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a MetaCell is as simple as writting metadata in markdown file.\n",
    "```md\n",
    "# This is title\n",
    "+ date: 2020-02-22\n",
    "+ tags: [hello, world]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the markdown capability of ipynb, MetaCell will be shown like the following:\n",
    "### This is title\n",
    "+ date: 2020-02-22\n",
    "+ tags: [hello, world]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, MetaCell itself will even enhance the readability of your notebooks! \n",
    "> Hint: In jupyter notebook, press `Esc+M` will switch selected cell to markdown mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The plugin is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The CSS of jupyter will not be taken into outputs\n",
    "+ The summary will be generated by Pelican\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is still powerful and extensible:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Math Support\n",
    "+ A Solution for metadata\n",
    "+ Several configurable preprocessors provided\n",
    "    - Metadata Extraction\n",
    "    - SubCell Selection\n",
    "    - Ignore cells with `#ignore` tag\n",
    "    - Empty Cell Removal\n",
    "+ You can change [preprocess.py](preprocess.py) and define your own preprocessors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessors\n",
    "### Metadata Extraction\n",
    "As we stated, **All and Only** Metadata should be stored at the first Cell of ipynb. If there is non-metadata content found, it will raise an exception. After the extraction of metadata, the **MetaCell will be removed**, as we have extracted all the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### SubCells Selection\n",
    "The Subcells preprocessor is executed after Metadata preprocessor (Th MetaCell it self will be removed by Metadata preprocessor), so\n",
    "**zeroth cell is the first cell after MetaCell**. The start and end should be written in the MetaCell like:\n",
    "```md\n",
    "# This is title\n",
    "+ date: 2020-02-22\n",
    "+ tags: [hello, world]\n",
    "+ subcells: [5, -1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The value will be evaluated by `start, end = ast.literal_eval(value)`. And then cells are sliced by `cells[start:end]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hint: If you want end to be infinity, use None\n",
    "\n",
    "### #ignore Tag\n",
    "You can include an `#ignore` comment at the beginning\n",
    "of a cell of the Jupyter notebook to ignore it, removing it from the post content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note it is more strict than `#ignore` tag in pelican-ipynb. The purpose is to prevent kicking normal contents out of post content.\n",
    "### Remove Empty Cells\n",
    "Remove trivial cells without visible characters using regular expression `\\S`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "### Dependency\n",
    "+ Currently works for `python3` only\n",
    "+ pelican\n",
    "+ nbconvert\n",
    "+ jupyter\n",
    "+ ipython\n",
    "Download this repo and put all the .py files it into an ipynb directory into your plugins directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `pelicanconf.py`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MARKUP = ('md', 'ipynb')\n",
    "PLUGIN_PATH = 'pelican-plugins'\n",
    "PLUGINS = ['pelican-plugins']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Options\n",
    "|Option|Default|Meaning|\n",
    "|------|-------|-------|\n",
    "|IPYNB_REMOVE_EMPTY|True|Remove Empty Cells, `True` by default|\n",
    "|IPYNB_IGNORE|True|Remove cells with `#ignore` tag at the beginning|\n",
    "|IPYNB_SUBCELLS|True|Only preserve Subcells specified by `subcells: [begin, end)` metadata|\n",
    "\n",
    "## TODO\n",
    "+ Fix the inperfect environment support?\n",
    "+ Syntax highlight for markdown cells\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgement\n",
    "Thanks to [pelican-ipynb](https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb)! From reading the code of the project, I have learned how to write a similiar plugin with my own ideas.\n"

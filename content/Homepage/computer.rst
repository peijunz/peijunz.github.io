Computer Skills
====================
I am also very interested in tinkering computer. Besides the knowledge learnt in classes, I have mastered many other skills such as LaTeX, Python, Git, etc. to make my life easier and study more efficient. In my daily life, I always use the Linux OS, which is spiritually free and highly customizable. I have learned the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) philosophy from Linux. I am deeply impressed by the free software movement initiated by `RMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman>`_.

The homepage is built with sphinx---the new python documentation generator. Writing documentation with sphinx is simple: only learning reStructuredText---a simple markup language is needed. I introduced this tool to one of my classmates, and he is very satisfied about its simplicity and convenience, even though he had little experience about this before. Also, sphinx has many extensions enable you to deal with code, math, etc. effectively.
